# -Carbonfootprint
Based on the Paris Climate Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol there is a global requirement to reduce GHG emissions.
With this project I will focus on two large emission contributers: agriculture and transportation in the urban environment.


Agriculture is responsible for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions (Source) but can also act as a sink of GHGs.

Simiilarty transportation hightly contributes to GHGs via freights, aviation and vehicle use.
